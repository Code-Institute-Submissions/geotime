# Geological Time - Mesozoic Era     

After a trip and holiday to the Burren in 2020 it ignited an interest in Irish Geology. The site is a starting point to inspire people to explore Geology and Geology in Ireland. There is so much to explore in Geology and dinosuars are what most people are drawn to first. I hope to inspire people to sign up and help the site to grow and decide on what to explore next. Drip feed Irish Geology, as our sea shores and aprks are full of fossils to view in the open. It is hoped with the chosen color and font scheme it will capture people of all ages.

## Suprises  
### Git Pull
Just getting ready for my first push with git, bit I was not allowed. I had to do a pull from the main repo. I had linked draw.io to my folder and had created a wireframe in the main repo. Hence the need for a pull before a push.

Using w3c validator for the first time not as bad as I expecting. Some corrections to form > legend. Also the quickest method for correcting flow issues with css. Finding missing closing tags.   

Now understand the full value of frequet git commits. Also keeps focus on one issue/task at a time.
