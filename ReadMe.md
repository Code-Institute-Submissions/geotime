# Milestone 1 - GeoTime  

## Suprises  
### Git Pull
Just getting ready for my first push with git, bit I was not allowed. I had to do a pull from the main repo. I had linked draw.io to my folder and had created a wireframe in the main repo. Hence the need for a pull before a push.

Using w3 validator for the first time not as bad as I expecting. SOme corrections to form > legend.
