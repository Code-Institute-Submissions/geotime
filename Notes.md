## Suprises ALong the Way   

### Git Pull   
Just getting ready for my first push with git, bit I was not allowed. I had to do a pull from the main repo. I had linked draw.io to my folder and had created a wireframe in the main repo. Hence the need for a pull before a push.

Using w3c validator for the first time not as bad as I expecting. Some corrections to form > legend. Also the quickest method for correcting flow issues with css. Finding missing closing tags.   

Now understand the full value of frequet git commits. Also keeps focus on one issue/task at a time.
